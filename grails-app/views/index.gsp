            <h2>How does it work in practice?</h2>
            <p>
            Open Mentor provides tutors with guidance by analysing the
      		comments they make and grouping them in four major
      		categories.

        		<li>Category A: Positive Reactions</li>
        		<li>Category B: Teaching Points</li>

        		<li>Category D: Negative Reactions</li>
